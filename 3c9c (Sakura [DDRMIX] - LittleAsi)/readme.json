There is an ultra secret extra difficulty between Expert and ExpertPlus!

How to play:
1. Rename Easy.json to EasyBackup.json.
2. Rename ExpertPlusMinus.json to Easy.json.
3. Start up Beat Saber and play on Easy.

Don't replace another difficulty, since the leaderboards will only be accurate if everyone replaces the same one!
